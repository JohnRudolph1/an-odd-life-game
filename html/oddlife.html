You let out a rusty yelp over and over again to what seems like no avail.  Tears are running down your face, not only from the pain in your throat, but the feeling of being alone.  You collapse, giving up.  As all seems for not, three miniature men appear from behind the surrounding trees.  Each is wearing potato sacks, and honestly they pull the look off rather well.  Not important.  You are caught off guard and let out a would-be shriek.  They look at you confused, yet still silent.  What do you do?</p>

Each of the potato-men are surrounding the fire sitting on tree stumps cooking what looks to be some type of animal.  The three men sense that you are now alert.  They stop what they are doing and stare at you.  The smaller of the three makes a grunt at you.  He hands your a cup whittled from wood with a liquid inside it. You don't care what it is.  As far as you know, it's been days since you've drank anything.  You gulp your drink down as fast as you possibly can.  </p>

Before you can utter a word, they all begin an ominous and loud chant..."ONE OF US, ONE OF US" over and over again.  It's nearly a celebration this point; the three mysterious potato-sacked men are ape-ish-ly dancing.  Amidst your own confusion over the situation, you start feeling a different type of weird.  Not one you've felt before.  Everything around you starts becoming bigger by couple feet.  You now realize that what you drank just shrank you.  The men approach you in an almost ceremonial fashion with a potato sack outfit that they pull over you.  You are now a fashionable potato-person.  The biggest of the three addresses you.  "You...you now my wife.  We now make marriage."  What do you do?</p>

You move into his hut with him following the ceremony, and start a life with him.  The two of you become inseperable and start a family, having three children: Poe, Tae, and little Toe.  You throw away the life you had before to be there for Hembar and the kids.  You live happily ever after.  The end.</p>

You are relieved to step onto the asphalt, but before you can get past the first house on the street, bright lights from a car approach you.  A man steps out, and without hesitation, offers you a ride.  You step in and buckle up.  "Sir, you have no idea what I've just been through!  You really saved my potato skin back there" you say in a now higher pitch voice due to the transformation.  "Don't worry," he says, "I'm going to help you.  You trust the man.  He pulls up to a trailer near a theme park.  You both enter the trailer, although you must admit this is not the help you were expecting.  He swiftyly yeets you into a cage and the door slams down shut.  It turns out the man runs a 'freak-show' in town, and you become the main display at his carnival for the rest of your life.

There is an INCREDIBLY awkward silence.  The potato men look at eachother in complete and utter confusion, shrug, and disappear into the woods where they came from.  They leave, and now you're alone once again.  You think to yourself how you really should have said something.  You can feel your conciousness slipping, and in a final act, you carve a message into a tree that reads "sorry, senpai".  You faint, and in your sleep you die from starvation and dehydration.

                                <p><strong>SWEET RELIEF.</strong>  You sprint to the well, knowing that water is more important than food.  There is a bucket tied to a rope that is attached to the crank-style apparatus.  You stick your head down the well to make sure it's not dried up, and it's still filled with water.  Quickly, you lower the bucket down, fill the bucket, and crank that sucker back up so you can quench your insatiable thirst seemlessly. You reach and grab the bucket with both hands from it's dangling position, but the bucket immediately becomes so extremely heavy that is drops like a bomb back into the well, pulling you with it...</p>

Somehow light is still reaching you, and new colors bounce around the never-ending walls while you hear new sounds that don't exist. "How far does this stupid well go?" you think to yourself.  After a while, boredom strikes and you have another overwhelming feeling that whatever you dwell <strong><em>DEFINITELY</em></strong> left a stove on...  </p>

You now realize that your height has changed to roughly the equivilent of the small thing next to you.  You reach for a light, but there is no lamp, only candles.  You light one in an attempt to see what's happening.  The person wakes up just as startled.  "Why you make hot color, wife?" the bearded dwarf barks.  You see what is going on here.

You stealthily approch the unknown stalk, but the plant grows in size (mainly length) twenty fold and extends far into the clouds.  It still looks yummy but you could try climbing it...what do you do?!</p>

It's disgusting, and getting harder to chew.  Your tongue swells due to an unknown allergy, and your throat closes.  You're dead.</p>
