                    <p>Although you're tired and your throat is burnt from being so parched, you try your hardest to scream for help.  You let out a rusty yelp over and over again to what seems like no avail.  Tears are running down your face, not only from the pain in your throat, but the feeling of being alone.  You collapse, giving up.  As all seems for not, three miniature men appear from behind the surrounding trees.  Each is wearing potato sacks, and honestly they pull the look off rather well.  Not important.  You are caught off guard and let out a would-be shriek.  They look at you confused, yet still silent.  What do you do?</p>

Each of the potato-men are surrounding the fire, and are sitting upon tree stumps cooking what looks to be some type of animal.  The three men sense that you are now alert.  They stop what they are doing and stare at you.  The smaller of the three makes a grunt at you.  He hands your a cup whittled from wood with a liquid inside it. You don't care what it is.  As far as you know, it's been days since you've drank anything.  You gulp your drink down as fast as you possibly can.  </p>

                        <p>The men watch you, smiling.  This concerns you, but maybe they're just generally cool dwarven wood people.  Before you can utter a word, they all begin an ominous and loud chant..."ONE OF US, ONE OF US" over and over again.  It's nearly a celebrationa this point, the three mysterious potato-sacked men are ape-ish-ly dancing.  Amidst your own confusion over the situation, you start feeling a different type of weird.  Not one you've felt before.  Everything around you starts becoming bigger by couple feet.  You now realize that what you drank just shrank you.  The men approach you in an almost ceremonial fashion with a potato sack outfit that they pull over you.  You are now a fashionable potato-person.  The biggest of the three addresses you.  "You...you now my wife.  We now make marriage."  What do you do?</p>

You move into his hut with him following the ceremony, and start a life with him.  The two of you become inseperable and start a family, having three children: Poe, Tae, and little Toe.  You throw away the life you had before to be there for Hembar and the kids.  You live happily ever after.  The end.</p>

You are relieved to step onto the asphalt, but before you can get past the first house on the street, bright lights from a car approach you.  A man steps out, and without hesitation, offers you a ride.  You step in and buckle up.  "Sir, you have no idea what I've just been through!  You really saved my potato skin back there" you say in a now higher pitch voice due to the transformation.  "Don't worry," he says, "I'm going to help you.  You trust the man.  He pulls up to a trailer near a theme park.  You both enter the trailer, although you must admit this is not the help you were expecting.  He swiftyly yeets you into a cage and the door slams down shut.  It turns out the man runs a 'freak-show' in town, and you become the main display at his carnival for the rest of your life.  Maybe the potato guys weren't so bad.  The End.</p>

There is an INCREDIBLY awkward silence.  The potato men look at eachother in complete and utter confusion, shrug, and disappear into the woods where they came from.  They leave, and now you're alone once again.  You think to yourself how you really should have said something.  You can feel your conciousness slipping, and in a final act, you carve a message into a tree that reads "sorry, senpai".  You faint, and in your sleep you die from starvation and dehydration.

The largest of the three (standing near four feet at most) sees you coming, and reaches behind him.
