Welcome to An Odd Life!  

A choose-your-path JavaScript game where you encounter some real strange situations, and your decision will progress your story!  

This is my 2019 Code Louisville final project submission!  Please have mercy, almight code Gods.

If you encounter a bug, PLEASE let me know, or fork and shoot me a pull request.  This is my first attempt at a webpage, so excuse any 'sloppy code' or non-condensed stylesheets.
