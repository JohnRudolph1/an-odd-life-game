Welcome to An Odd Life!  

A choose-your-path JavaScript game where you encounter some real strange situations, and your decision will progress your story!  

If you encounter a bug, PLEASE let me know, or fork and shoot me a pull request.  This is my first attempt at a webpage, so excuse any 'sloppy code' or non-condensed stylesheets.

I'm currently hosting this on my GitHub if you're not interested in the code, and just the final product.
